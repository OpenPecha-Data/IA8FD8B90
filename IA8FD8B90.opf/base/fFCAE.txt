The Importance of Mindfulness and Vigilance[1]

by Mipham Rinpoche

Namo guru mañjuśrīye!

When we settle evenly to look within,Our mind’s wild, discursive thoughtAppears as limitless
as ripples in a river,As indeterminable as a cloudless sky,As unceasing as a mighty torrent,And
as aimless as the passing breeze.Indulging in this throughout time without beginningHas
not brought us even the slightest benefit.Now, setting ourselves up for such effects
again in future,It is as if we’re tormented, possessed by demons or diseased.By continuing
to indulge negative habits and tendenciesWe’ll revert, like an unfurled scroll, to the same
predicament.

It is these waves of uncontrolled distractionThat are the source of the harm we inflict upon
ourselves.When, therefore, we establish the sentinel of mindfulness,We must eliminate entirely
all ideas and imaginingsAbout anything other than the primary object of focus.Then,
we must calmly maintain such presence and vigilance,And quash anything that might stir or
arise within the mind.

Unless we can maintain an uninterrupted chain of vigilanceThe samādhi of śamatha will prove
elusive even after a hundred aeons.

In time, when demonic thoughts lose their strengthAnd the mind is workable, engaged or settled
at will,The qualities of samādhi will arise within the heart.Until then don’t stop, child,
but let familiarity increase.

Mipham Nampargyalwa wrote this on the fourth day of the second month of the Water Snake year
(1893). Maṅgalam.
